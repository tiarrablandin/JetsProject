## Description

<br> Create an app storing a fleet of aircraft used to pull information, deploy, add, and remove jets.

## Tech Used

<br> Java, file I/O, Interfaces

## Lessons Learned# JetsProject

<br> I re-learned what a for each loop is. I also got clarification on the whole implements process because I didn't really know what the point of that was. I'm also starting to understand more and more every day about objects and constructors. They're still a little hard for me to grasp.

## Questions

<br> I wasn't able to make my fleet private because when I went to add, it wouldn't let me add using the setter (or the getter, I tried just about everything). Can I get some clarification on what I could've done differently to make this work?

<br> I was also forced to declare my attack and board methods as either static or default. I was under the impression that we never used default, and we only used static for our main. Can I get some clarification on what I'm doing wrong here?
